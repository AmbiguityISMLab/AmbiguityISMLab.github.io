<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
<p><b>What are the major goals of the project?</b></p>
This project seeks to understand how inaccurate messages are propagated over large-scale information networks that are consumed by the general public, how the public responds to such inaccuracy, and what content- or metadata-related characteristics/features make certain messages more error-resistant or error-prone than others. The results of the project have the potential to help build a platform that accurately identifies errors being propagated on an information network and effectively manages/controls such error propagation.<br><br>

<p><b>What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?</b></p>
Major Activities<br>
Research efforts in San Antonio have focused on developing novel data-driven methods for detecting misinformation, i.e, rumors and theory-driven approaches for modelling its propagation in healthcare context. Research efforts in Tampa have focused on developing algorithms to detect ambiguity in social media data (tweets). Research efforts in Buffalo have focused on learning intuitive low-dimensional representations of social media data (e.g., Tweets) using manifold learning methods.<br><br>

Specific Objectives<br>
The specific objectives include understanding how inaccurate messages are propagated over large-scale information networks that are consumed by the general public, how the public responds to such inaccuracy, and what content- or metadata-related characteristics/features make certain messages more error-resistant or error-prone than others.<br><br>

Significant Results<br>
This project has developed three streams of work to date.<br>
1.	In the first stream, we have developed new algorithms that can scale to high dimensional data streams and learn, in a streaming fashion, the low-dimensional representation of the data.  The work has developed methods that can be used to map social media data to a low-dimensional space in real time and allow for identification of evolution of anomalous topics.<br>
2.	In the second stream, we analyzed what makes citizens prone to engaging in cyber-rumor sharing. We investigated the effect of the threat and proximity from the threat. We evaluated the effect of social, temporal and spatial distances (proximity) on cyber-rumor sharing. We find that spatial and temporal distance is negatively associated with threat appeal. We also find that social and spatial distance is negatively associated with the likelihood of cyber-rumor sharing.<br>
3.	In the third stream, we have developed a system for automated detection of prejudiced messages from social media feeds. Intergroup prejudice is a distorted opinion held by one social group about another, without examination of facts. It is heightened during crises or threat. It finds expression in social media platforms when a group of people express anger, resentment and dissent towards another. The system developed uses a knowledge discovery framework that preprocesses data, generates theory-driven linguistic features along with other features engineered from textual content, annotates and models historical data to determine what drives detection of intergroup prejudice especially during a crisis. It is tested on tweets collected during the Boston Marathon bombing event. The system can be used to curb abuse and harassment by detection and reporting of intergroup prejudice.<br><br>

Key outcomes or Other achievements<br>
The research has generated several conference papers, theree journal papers and has been instrumental in graduating one Phd student<br><br>

<p><b>What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?</b></p>
This research has trained three MS and one PhD student on misinformation detection methods, and another PhD student on misinformation propagation modelling and on intuitive low-dimensional representations of social media data (e.g., Tweets) using manifold learning methods.<br><br>

<p><b>How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?</b></p>
The results have been disseminated in the form of workshop and journal papers and a thesis publication.<br><br>

<p><b>What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?</b></p>
We are currently collecting ambiguous tweets from verified accounts using MTurk.The next part of the research will be focused on developing algorithms to detect ambiguity in social media data (tweets).<br><br>

Integrating Crisis Semantics and Microblog Structure for Extracting Error-Prone Information: A Case Study of Boston Bombing in Twitterverse.  Microblogs have gained popularity as one of the prominent news sources, and emerged as an organic communication medium for hot topics and breaking news during crisis response. However, microblogs are plagued by error-prone information, which affects delivery of breaking news. Along this backdrop, this study aims to address the following research question: What features can be utilized to allow extraction of error-prone information from the organic conversation among the public?.
