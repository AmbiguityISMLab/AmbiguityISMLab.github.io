			Rohit Valecha, Varun Chandola, Manish Agrawal, H. Raghav Rao (2018). Integrating Crisis Semantics and Microblog Structure for Extracting Error-Prone Information: A Case Study of Boston Bombing in Twitterverse.  Microblogs have gained popularity as one of the prominent news sources, and emerged as an organic communication medium for hot topics and breaking news during crisis response. However, microblogs are plagued by error-prone information, which affects delivery of breaking news. Along this backdrop, this study aims to address the following research question: What features can be utilized to allow extraction of error-prone information from the organic conversation among the public?.
