<p><b>Project Goals</b></p>
This project seeks to understand how error messages are propagated over large-scale information networks and what content-related cues or network-related features make certain error messages more error-resistant or error-prone than others. The results of the project have the potential to help build a platform that accurately identifies errors being propagated on an information network and effectively manages such error propagation.<br><br>

<p><b>Research Challenges</b></p>
We have conceptualized errors as unverified messages. We have conceptualized error resistance and error proneness based on unverified message’s propagation. For exploring characteristics that make an unverified message error-prone, we investigate the positive effect of coded features/cues on its propagation, and the negative effect for error-resistance of unverified messages. We obtained 7 error topics that were unverified in news and media outlets.
We have commenced coding of threat and fear appeals, emotion analysis, risk analysis, crisis communication and health information cues for investigating the effect on error propagation (error proneness and error resistance).<br><br>

<p><b>Current/Final Results (summary)</b></p>
The results indicate that fear appeals (threat and protection) and risk communication (risk and benefit) lead to a positive effect on unverified message’s propagation signifying error-proneness, while emotion analysis (anxiety and hope) is associated with a negative effect on unverified message’s propagation denoting error-resistance. In addition, health information (medical, strategies and actions) is related to error-proneness, while crisis communication (crisis, accidents and alerts) leads to error-resistance. Furthermore, messages from organizations as well as spatially distant from location of incidence resist the propagation of erroneous information while network-related characteristics (hashtag and followers) increase the propagation.<br><br>

<p><b>Broader Impacts</b></p>
The research has developed novel theory- and data-driven models for modelling error propagation. On completion, it will extend models of fear appeals, risk analysis, crisis communication among others to investigate error proneness and error resistance.<br><br>
